//  We are g1iven a school. In the school there are classes of students. Each class has a set of teachers. 
//  Each teacher teaches a set of disciplines. Students have name and unique class number. 
//  Classes have unique text identifier. Teachers have name. Disciplines have name, number 
//  of lectures and number of exercises. Both teachers and students are people. Students,
//  classes, teachers and disciplines could have optional comments (free text block).
//  Your task is to identify the classes (in terms of  OOP) and their attributes and operations,
//  encapsulate their fields, define the class hierarchy and create a class diagram with Visual Studio.
